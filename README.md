# Adc_program_for_TGS_822
This project reads analog output from the TGS 822 gas sensor using the ADC of the STM32F446RE board. The sensor detects gases like alcohol and solvents. The ADC converts the sensorâ€™s analog signal into digital values using STM32CubeIDE and STM32CubeMX. The program forms a base for gas detection or air quality monitoring systems.
